# 🎲 Tenzies Game

A fun and interactive dice game built using **React**. The objective is simple — roll the dice until all dice show the same number. You can "hold" dice to lock their value between rolls. This game also includes a timer, roll counter, and accessibility features to ensure an inclusive experience for all users.
